                <p>
                    <b>Nikola Tesla</b> was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who made significant contributions to the development of modern electrical systems and technology. He was born on July 10, 1856, in the village of Smiljan in what is now Croatia, and he died on January 7, 1943, in New York City, USA.

                   <b>Here are some key highlights of Tesla's life and work:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>AC (Alternating Current) Power</b>: Tesla is perhaps best known for his work on alternating current (AC) electrical systems. He developed the AC induction motor and transformer, which revolutionized the generation and distribution of electrical energy. His contributions in this area were instrumental in the development of the modern electrical power industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Tesla Coil</b>: Tesla invented the Tesla coil, a type of resonant transformer circuit that produces high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. It has been used in various applications, including radio transmission and experimental wireless energy transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Wireless Communication</b>: Tesla also experimented with wireless communication and demonstrated the feasibility of wireless transmission of electricity and information. His work laid the foundation for many wireless technologies we use today, including radio and remote control systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>X-rays</b>: Tesla conducted early experiments with X-rays and even produced X-ray images. However, he did not publish his findings, and the credit for the discovery of X-rays is often attributed to Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Wardenclyffe Tower</b>: Tesla conceived the idea of the Wardenclyffe Tower, a wireless transmission station intended to transmit messages and power wirelessly over long distances. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties, the project was never completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Contributions to Electricity and Magnetism</b>: Tesla made numerous contributions to the understanding of electricity and magnetism. He held numerous patents for his inventions and innovations
